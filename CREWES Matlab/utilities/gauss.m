function g=gauss(f,fnot,fwidth)
% GAUSS: returns a gaussian distribution sampled in frequency
%
% g=gauss(f,fnot,fwidth) 
%
% returns a gaussian distribution sampled at the frequencies
% given in the vector f
%
% f= input frequency vector
% fnot= frequency at which gaussian is centered
% fwidth= 1/e width of gaussian
% g= output gaussian distribution
%
% i.e. g=exp(-((f-fnot)/fwidth).^2);
