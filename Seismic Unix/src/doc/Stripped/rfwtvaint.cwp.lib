RFWTVAINT - Rasterize a Float array as Wiggle-Trace-Variable-Area, with
	    8 point sinc INTerpolation.

rfwtvaint	rasterize a float array as wiggle-trace-variable-area, and
		apply sinc interploation for display purposes.

Function Prototype:
void rfwtvaint (int n, float z[], float zmin, float zmax, float zbase,
	int yzmin, int yzmax, int xfirst, int xlast,
	int wiggle, int nbpr, unsigned char *bits, int endian);

Input:
n		number of samples in array to rasterize
z		array[n] to rasterize
zmin		z values below zmin will be clipped
zmax		z values above zmax will be clipped
zbase		z values between zbase and zmax will be filled (see notes)
yzmin		horizontal raster coordinate corresponding to zmin
yzmax		horizontal raster coordinate corresponding to zmax
xfirst		vertical raster coordinate of z[0] (see notes)
xlast		vertical raster coordinate of z[n-1] (see notes)
wiggle		=0 for no wiggle (VA only); =1 for wiggle (with VA)
                wiggle 2<=wiggle<=5 for solid/grey coloring of VA option
                shade of grey: wiggle=2 light grey, wiggle=5 black
nbpr		number of bytes per row of bits
bits		pointer to first (top,left) byte in image
endian		byte order  =1 big endian  =0 little endian 

Output:
bits		pointer to first (top,left) byte in image

Notes:
The raster coordinate of the (top,left) bit in the image is (0,0).
In other words, x increases downward and y increases to the right.
Raster scan lines run from left to right, and from top to bottom.
Therefore, xfirst, xlast, yzmin, and yzmax should not be less than 0.
Likewise, yzmin and yzmax should not be greater than nbpr*8-1, and 
care should be taken to ensure that xfirst and xlast do not cause bits 
to be set outside (off the bottom) of the image. 

Variable area fill is performed on the right-hand (increasing y) side
of the wiggle.  If yzmin is greater than yzmax, then z values between
zmin will be plotted to the right of zmax, and z values between zbase
and zmin are filled.  Swapping yzmin and yzmax is an easy way to 
reverse the polarity of a wiggle.

The variable "endian" must have a value of 1 or 0. If this is
not a case an error is returned.

The interpolation is by the 8 point sinc interpolation routine s8r.
