DIFFERENTIATE - simple DIFFERENTIATOR codes

differentiate - 1D two point centered difference based derivative

Function Prototype:
void differentiate(int n, float h, float *f, float *fprime);
void ddifferentiate(int n, double h, double *f, double *fprime);

differentiate:
Input:
n		number of samples
h		sample rate
f		array[n] of input values
Output:
fprime		array[n], the derivative of f

fprime:
Notes:
This is a simple 2 point centered-difference differentiator.
The derivatives at the endpoints are computed via 2 point leading and
lagging differences.
